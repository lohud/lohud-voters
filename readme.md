# lohud Voter Lookup tool

Working version can be seen [here](http://data.lohud.com/tools/voterlookup)

An old project that I (Kai Teoh) inherited. Lots of legacy code that has been refactored to make it slightly more readable. Was updated to run on PHP 5.6 from PHP 5.??, but still runs a lot of deprecated code.

**RGrid.php** was modified to run on later versions of PHP.
